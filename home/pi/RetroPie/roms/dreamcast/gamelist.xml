    <name>102 Dalmatians - Puppies to the Rescue</name>
    <desc>The game itself follows the films' storyline loosely. The player can choose the role of one of two dalmatians, Oddball or Domino, who are out in the backyard looking for treasure. It is not long before the player realizes that a toy found buried in a park was made at one of Cruella de Vil's toy factories; this alludes to the fact that Cruella's toy sales are down, which ultimately leads to the problem in the storyline. Facing financial ruin from lack of sales, Cruella sets an evil plan in motion - to reprogram her toys to capture any pets in sight. Oddball and Domino are the only puppies in their family who have not been captured when they return from the park. Their parents, Dottie and Dipstick, set out to rescue their puppies, commanding Oddball and Domino to stay home and 'be good.' The puppies do not listen, and are soon out on their biggest adventure yet - to save their brothers and sisters, and their parents who are captured along the way.</desc>

    <name>18 Wheeler - American Pro Trucker</name>
    <desc>The main purpose of the game is to make it to the finish line with the truck's cargo. Players are given a set amount of time, but can ram into special vans that will add three seconds to the timer. There are several characters to choose from, each with a unique truck and attributes.    The game starts out in Key West and players travel across the United States, ending in San Francisco. After Stage 1, the game gives the player a choice of trailer. One trailer is harder to haul, but provides a bigger payoff while the other choice is easier to haul but provides a smaller payoff. Money is deducted from the total when the trailer is hit. Players can sound the truck's horn to make other cars on the road yield and slipstream behind large vehicles to gain a momentary speed boost.    In addition to the time limit, players also compete with the "Lizard Tail", a rival trucker. Crossing the finish line before the Lizard Tail yields additional money. In between levels, players can park the truck in a mini game to earn more cash.</desc>

    <name>4 Wheel Thunder</name>
    <desc>4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the popular power-boat racing game, Hydro Thunder.  In this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night, rain/sunshine variations. The game includes the standard championship, practice race, and 2-player modes.  The thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, but in finding the "boost" power-ups that lie around the tracks.  Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of his or her truck dramatically. Without the boost power-ups, the player has no hope of winning a race.</desc>

    <name>AeroWings 2: Airstrike</name>
    <desc>Whereas the first AeroWings game was all about flight acrobatics, AeroWings 2: Air Strike is a fighter jet game. The most important modes selectable are free flight, which as the name implies gives you freedom to fly what you want (land it in the middle of a freeway if you'd like or next to skyscrapers) and over what type of weather and the split-screen versus mode (2 player). In addition to those modes, the game features training in  over 30 fighter training missions and 15 tactical challenges. Successful completion of these challenges will unlock additional fighters (including the XF-3 Super Recipro, F-2B Support Fighter or F-15DJ Aggressor 2 to name a few) and decals/paint for the plane models.   As far as the realism goes, the game is customizable with options for either Standard or Professional Flight controls. The main difference between the two being the inclusion of more realistic G-Forces on your plane. It's also important to note that the controls are nearly identical to the first game with one or two buttons difference. </desc>

    <name>Border Down</name>
    <desc>A futuristic sci-fi shooter in which you play a test pilot strapped to the brand new RAIN combat simulator which allows you to remotely control fighters as they immerse themselves in the midst of enemy territory.  The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which you control your ship and try to survive the onslaught of enemy attacks while you attempt to clear the levels. Weapon upgrades are based on collectible power-ups, but the game mostly relies on a power bar that fills as you destroy enemies and which allows you to unleash your super weapon at the expense of decreased normal firepower. The game also features a unique "border" system which involves three separate routes through each stage. You select the default route at the start of a level and when your ship is destroyed you get knocked down to the next "border", which features alternate backgrounds and enemy patterns. Only if you get knocked off the last border you lose the game.  Uses completely polygonal graphics and features single player arcade, remix and practice modes through 6 enemy-infested stages, the last of which has four unique variations.</desc>

    <desc>Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001, known in Japan as Capcom vs. SNK 2: Millionaire Fighting 2001 (ã‚«ãƒ—ã‚³ãƒ³ ãƒ ãƒ¼ã‚µã‚¹ ã‚¨ã‚¹ãƒ»ã‚¨ãƒŒãƒ»ã‚±ã‚¤ 2 ãƒŸãƒªã‚ªãƒ ã‚¢ ãƒ•ã‚¡ã‚¤ãƒ†ã‚£ãƒ³ã‚° 2001 Kapukon bÄ sasu Esu-enu-kei TsÅ«: Mirionea Faitingu TsÅ« Sausando Wan?), is the sequel to the fighting game Capcom vs. SNK. It was originally released on NAOMI hardware in arcades. As in the original, players select a team of fighters from various Capcom and SNK games then fight other teams, winning each battle by defeating all the opponents from the other team.    Aspects of the first game were tweaked, including the Ratio system. In contrast to the fixed system of the original, players can now freely select characters and assign each of them a number from one to four (or "Ratio") determining their relative strength, adding up to a maximum team ratio of four. Teams can now consist of a maximum of three characters, as opposed to four in the first game. Additional characters were added, including more characters from Capcom and SNK titles outside of the Street Fighter and King of Fighters series. The Groove system from Millennium Fight 2000 has been augmented to include four new systems of play based on various Capcom and SNK fighting games. In addition, the number of buttons has been increased from the Neo Geo standard of four to the six button system first seen in Capcom's Street Fighter.    The game was initially ported to the Sega Dreamcast, followed by a version for the PlayStation 2. The GameCube and Xbox received an updated version titled Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO, with the "EO" referring to "Easy Operation", a game option intended for novices to the game. The PS2 version was later released on PlayStation Network in July 2013.[2]</desc>

    <name>Carrier</name>
    <desc>Carrier is the first survival horror game released for the Dreamcast.  As the game starts you are Jack Ingles, a member of a special forces team.  You are sent in by Helicopter to investigate a carrier that has not been responding to radio contact after completing a mission. As you approach the deck of the carrier, your helicopter is shot down.  After crash landing on the deck, it is your job to investigate what exactly is going on, and escape alive.  The game is played from a third person perspective.  You move Jack around the ship, shooting enemies and solving simple puzzles along the way.  The main goal of the game is to survive, so you have to be careful about conserving ammo and health upgrades.  After you solve the game playing as Jack, you can play through the game again as Jessifer Manning, one of your teammates.  While playing as Jessifer, you get an entirely different view of the same story.</desc>

    <desc>This is a remake or "modernaization" of the classic arcade shooter Centipede, originally released in arcades by Atari in 1980.  This remake keeps some of the original game's shooter-style gameplay while mixing in more console-style exploration.  Gameplay progresses through five "worlds":  Weedom, Frostonia, Infernium, Enigma, and Evile.  Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom.  A "classic" mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new "3D" isometric perspective.</desc>

    <desc>Chaos Field is a top-down space shooter similar in concept to the Gradius series, or Ikaruga. You control one of three ships, each with their own pilot and unique weapon systems.   The game takes place over 5 phases, in each phase you face a number of boss battles. Unlike other games if this genre, almost the entire game is composed of boss battles, each boss requiring a different strategy to defeat.   The game also uses a unique in-game difficulty adjuster. Called "fields", you can play in either Order or Chaos. Compared to Order, the Chaos Field offers you increased fire power and abilities, but also does the same for your enemies. Order Field is more relaxed on both sides. If you can play in the Chaos Field, you stand to gain substantially more points.</desc>

    <desc>Charge 'N Blast is a shooting game where you play as one of three marines who have to rid the earth of alien scum. The gameplay is similar to Cabal, you move left and right dodging enemies while charging up you weapons to blast them away.  There are three different marines you can choose from, each with their own set of weapons. As usual there is the balanced character (Johnny Rock), a weaker but faster one (Pamela Hewitt) and a slower but stronger one (Nicholas Woods).  You can choose to play in one player mode, time attack or two player mode. The missions are broken up into small areas where you have to kill all enemies before moving on to the next area. Each mission ends with a boss character such as a giant insect or a Godzilla-like monster.  Use the X, Y or B buttons to choose a weapon, press A to charge and shoot and aim with analog stick. There are different types of weapons that can be used on the different types of enemies. For example the single missiles for far away targets and torpedoes for underwater enemies.  You can fire your weapon continuously, but this doesn't do as much damage compared to a fully charged shot. Charging each shot means you have to aim a little more carefully, but you'll especially need this in the later levels. You can dodge enemies with the L and R buttons. </desc>

The construction part is set up with a screen divided in four camera angles and a grid based building tool. Using vector pieces, the player has to make a roller coaster that meets the requirements of the specific park. The pieces can be tilted, elevated, lowered and turned to make sure the ride is as exciting as possible.  After the roller coaster is done it will be tested with a crash test dummy (who's also able to squeal like an excited kid), to make sure it meets such requirements as safety, speed, excitement etc. This is done in a 1st person view, allowing the player to come along for the ride as well.  There are 6 different stages, each with different sizes and limitations.</desc>

The game includes the popular features of the Virtua Cop series "Justice Shot" (in which you shoot an enemy's gun or gun arm instead of killing them) and the "Combo Shot" in which you can hit an enemy with up to three shots before they expire.  The home version does include some mini-games and training modes that were not in the arcade version of the game.</desc>

Confused, Amp is told by this rabbit, named Yusa, that this is Cool Cool Town and the only way to get out and back into your room is to win the Flitzing competition. Yusa then takes Amp under her proverbial wing and teaches him how to Flitz. It is a different story, that is for sure and it is far from boring or useless. The story progresses well too and by the end, you will be wondering just what the hell is going on... Followed by a satisfying ending that makes everything before it, make sense.

    <desc>Cosmic Smash for Dreamcast is a port of the Sega Rosso arcade game. It is a futuristic sports game, a mix of squash and Breakout.  The player controls a semi-transparent human male in third-person view. The goal is to clear each level from a set of different blocks at the far end of the room within a given time limit. Additional time is given at the start of the next level depending on how well the player did. To clear the room, the player has to hit a ball with a racket at the correct angle. The ball bounces back from the blocks and walls. The blocks have different properties, for example, some have to be hit multiple times before they disappear, while others move around thus making them harder to hit.  Besides the regular shot, the player can also perform a trick shot, which in combination with other moves gives extra points when successfully executed. At the end of each level, a map with branching paths is displayed, enabling the player to take different routes towards the end of the game.</desc>

    <name>Crazy Taxi</name>
    <desc>Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short.   In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.  Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</desc>

    <desc>In the middle of a raging blizzard, Laura opens her eyes to find herself inside a mountain cabin. She was saved by Kimberly, one of the passengers of the wrecked plane. Ten days have passed since the crash but Laura can remember nothing, not even her name. The door of the cabin opens and one of the terrorists enters. While Kimberly and Laura stare in horror, he transforms into a hideous monster. He is not the only one. Other crash survivors and locals have mutated into terrifying monstrosities and attacked people. Is there anyway to survive this living nightmare? At present it is shrouded in mystery.    D-2 is a follow-up to D, though the two games are not directly connected to each other story-wise and also have significant differences in gameplay. D-2 combines a horror theme with shooter and role-playing elements. Exploring the vast snowy landscape and investigating the surroundings triggers extensive cutscenes that advance the narrative. The 3D engine allows free navigation around the world, though in-door locations have first-person navigation with limited movement. It is also possible to pilot a snowmobile, hunt for food, and capture photos.</desc>

    <desc>Just like the arcade version, pick one of three tracks (beginner, advanced, or expert) and either automatic or standard transmission. A pounding music soundtrack kicks in as you are slapped into your car to await the green light. The game offers both a traditional arcade mode with checkpoint time splits and a special PC mode that pits you against the other cars over different race distances. The PC mode also offers more car choices, with a variety of speed, acceleration, and grip characteristics. It even rewards successful players (meaning those finishing first, second, or third in the difficult setting) by offering up to ten more upgraded cars to drive. Once underway, the goal is to work from last to first as smoothly and quickly as possible </desc>

    <desc>On July 29, 2010, the city of Saronica comes under attack by an army of monsters called the SMO as they lay siege to the city, capturing it and ruling the populace under an iron fist.  During this, The Resistance is formed in an attempt to stop the SMO, lead by a woman by the name of Lily who is kidnapped when she attempts to help a man by the name of Kou.  After she is captured, it is learned the man has come into possession of two ancient pistols by the name of "Crimson" that can destroy the monsters and their vicious leader.  Kou sets out with Lily's daughter, Yuri, to bring her back and stop the evil forces within the city.  Death Crimson is a light-gun game similar in style to House of the Dead where the player shoots at enemies that pop up on screen and save innocents from the monsters.  The player can also power-up the "Crimson" pistols by shooting death flowers that will turn their firepower into machine guns to decimate hordes of enemies.  There is also a health meter that will increase in size by successfully shooting enemies, gaining experience points.   Once enough points are obtained, the health bar will increase, however missing enemies or shooting civilians will take away points.</desc>

    <name>Dino Crisis</name>
    <desc>Three years ago a brilliant scientist disappeared while researching a new form of energy. The government that funded his research wrote the whole affair off as a loss, which made it all the more upsetting when reports of Dr. Kirk's good health and nearly finished research came in. A special forces team is sent to the doctor's private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally unprepared for some of the side effects of his developments. Side effects that come from 100 million years in the past.  Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find "plugs" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors.</desc>

    <name>Evolution 2: Far Off Promise</name>
    <desc>Evolution 2 is a direct sequel to World of Sacred Device. The events of the game take place six months after the conclusion of the previous game. Mag Launcher, the son of a great adventurer of the past, has earned the title of "best adventurer" in the town Pannam. The adventurer guild (called the Society) sends him to the south, to the large town Museville. Mag has to explore the surrounding dungeons, performing various archaeological quests for the Society.  The game is more like a second chapter to the first Evolution than an actual sequel. You control the same party of characters: Mag, the cute girl Linear Cannon, the butler Gre Naid, and the adventurers Chain and Pepper. The dungeons are randomly generated. In those dungeons, you can find rare artifacts you can later sell, and special weapon enhancements called "CyFrame", which can upgrade your characters and teach them various techniques.  The US version of Evolution: Far off Promise features original Japanese voice-acting with English subtitles. </desc>

    <desc>As many as four (Expansion Pak required) can band together in an epic quest through seven magical worlds -- three of which are brand-new to the home version -- to defeat the vile Skorne.   The nonlinear action begins in a hub, which leads to the worlds, each with two to five levels. You can complete a level in one world, then move to another world, returning later to finish a new level in the first world.   Developer Atari Games has delivered four new characters in addition to the four in the arcade version. Each character will have unique special attacks. Controller Pak support will allow players to team their evolving characters.   Enemies, bosses, power-ups, music and sound effects are all getting radical makeovers. Atari is busily remapping carryover levels and cooking up devious new puzzles and hiding places for items, so don't even think of cribbing from the coin-op version.    Graphical updates include real-time lighting, which is nowhere to be found in the arcade version. The N64 Expansion Pak pushes plenty of polygon-based enemies onto the screen.   The essential action -- team up with others, find keys, magic, runes and other items, and beat the stuffing out of anyone in your way -- remains unchanged from the arcade hit. Atari has delivered a far meatier storyline, though, spiffed up by cinema cut-scenes at the successful conclusion of a world. </desc>

There are four characters to choose from, each with his own storyline and fighter/spaceship. Each ship has its own weapon type and speed.  Like the previous Giga Wing and Mars Matrix games, gameplay is designed around bullet absorption/reflection mechanics, large numbers of enemies, and giant boss fights. Giga Wing 2 adds the ability to choose from two different bullet reflection powers: reflect force and reflect laser. The reflect force repulses enemy shots, while the reflect laser uses them to charge up a beam weapon. </desc>

    <desc>In the World of Giga Wing, many wars have been fought for the divine stone Medallion. Entire civilizations were destroyed in the struggle for gaining control of the legendary item. Now, in the year 2050, four pilots have set off, each carrying a mysterious stone. The stones are said to be the only way to destroy Medallion once and for all. The player can choose to complete the journey for any of the four pilots.  Giga Wing is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up. Up to two players must steer their planes around enemy bullets and destroy everything in their path with only a limited amount of lives. When tapping the A button, the main gun is fired. Holding the button activates the Reflect Force. The B button fires a bomb from a limited stock to become temporarily invincible. Power-ups can be collected to increase the bomb and life stock or enhance the main gun's fire power.  Scoring works by using the Reflect Force to repel enemy shots. Once the shots hit an enemy, medals appear in their place. When these are collected, the score multiplier increases.  There are two game modes, arcade and score attack. Arcade plays just like the original coin-op game, and score attack lets the player choose a stage and fight for the highest score there. In this mode, the player has unlimited lives, however the score multiplier will reset once the player dies or uses a bomb. </desc>

    <name>Grand Theft Auto 2</name>
    <desc>Lie, cheat, and steal your way through three districts of a huge city in the follow-up to Grand Theft Auto. Earn the respect of 7 different gangs as you demolish the town in your attempt to make lots of cash.    The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.    Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.    New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.</desc>

    <name>Guilty Gear X</name>
    <desc>When the humans created artificial beings named "gears" in 22th century, they didn't expect that their creation will eventually turn against them. Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner.  "Guilty Gear X" is a follow up to  Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you can perform. Beside special attacks which you can execute if you build up your Tension Gauge by attacking or advancing towards your opponent, there is also a variety of defensing moves to perform. The instant kill moves are back from the previous game.</desc>

Based on a two-colors system, the player has to switch between the black &amp; white sides of his ship during gameplay. The black side is immune to black enemy bullets which it consider as bonus, and dies on impact with a white enemy bullets. Your own black bullets damages white enemies twice as more as white bullets. And vice-versa for the white side. Those properties makes a balance between protecting yourself well and killing enemies fast.   This aspect, combined with specific enemy patterns and a combo system makes Ikaruga an original shoot-em-up with a dose of strategy.</desc>

Four teenage horror fans, Eriko Christy, Kevin Kertsman, Randy Fairbanks, and Michel Waters, receive invitations to the ghastly park. Filled with enthusiasm, Kevin, Randy, and Michel carelessly rush to Illbleed, leaving behind young Eriko. Eriko eventually heads to Illbleed to search for her now-missing friends. Eriko must find her friends, survive the horrors of Illbleed, and get out alive, if she can.  Each "amusement" in Illbleed is based on one of Michael Reynolds' horror films, from the worm infested drive-in theater of Revenge of the Worm to the trap-laden supermarket of Killer Department Store. The player can choose to play a level with any of the kids that have been rescued, and one character is trapped in each of the attractions. Robots modeled on the movies' monsters populate each attraction as well, and each is programmed to attack and kill attendees. In addition to the robots, every room in an attraction is fitted with traps to surprise and hurt. If the player character becomes too surprised they'll die of a heart attack. Prize money is awarded for surviving each attraction, and can be used to upgrade a character's stats or buy items.</desc>

The most obvious point is that although most planes come from real World War 2 aircraft, the theatre of operations is a bit unique; The four major sides to the conflict (American, British, German, Japanese) are all fighting one another over a group of islands somewhere in the Pacific. Thus each of these nations is represented in close proximity and in direct conflict to one another.  The gameplay takes place over a series of single-player flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British. The majority of the missions take place in the air against other aerial targets.</desc>

They didn't know that Kao was quite proficient in the art of boxing, so freeing himself from the trap wasn't particularly hard. However, Kao finds himself far away from home, and must fight and hop his way back.    Kao the Kangaroo is a 3D platform action game. The gameplay adheres to the jump-and-run style, Kao having to rapidly traverse levels full of traps and enemies. His basic attack is a simple punch; he can also side-step and swing his tail at the enemies. Power-ups scattered through the stages include coins, a certain amount of which will increase Kao's life points; hearts to replenish his health; boxing gloves, which act as homing projectile attacks; and turbo boosts, which make Kao move faster.</desc>

Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the "insolence" of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss.  There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...  Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.  Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark gift") upon drinking it's soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.  The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes  requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are "block puzzles", requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas. </desc>

    <name>Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes</name>
    <desc>Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes is a 2D fighting game that combines characters from Capcom's videogames with characters from the Marvel comic universe, similar to Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter. The game takes place in a Marvel universe where Professor Charles Xavier asks the heroes to help him before he merges with the consciousness of Magneto to form the being known as Onslaught, the final boss.  The game follows the standard fighting gameplay, but different from X-Men vs. Street Fighter you now have to make up a squad of three characters instead of two. The other characters can be summoned for assist attacks and there is also a duo team attack to control two characters for a brief time, along with the ability to perform super moves where the characters team up.  Options include a straight arcade battle, 4-player tag modes (Dreamcast version only), a survival mode (much like Street Fighter Alpha 3) and a training mode. The PlayStation version does not have the 4-player tag mode and also reduces the second character to an assist role, but in addition introduces a "crossover" mode where tag-team play with identical teams is possible.  For Marvel the cast of playable characters includes Spider Man, Captain America, Venom, Hulk, Gambit, War Machine, Wolverine, Gold War Machine (secret character), Hyper Venom (secret character), Orange Hulk (secret character) and Onslaught (secret character). The Capcom side offers Chun-Li, Ryu, Zangief, Morrigan Aensland, Captain Commando, Megaman (Rockman in Asia), Strider Hiryu, Jin Saotome, Roll (secret character), Lilith-Mode Morrigan (secret character) and Shadow Lady (secret character). There is also a large number of special partners that can be summoned. </desc>

There are detailed statistics for each team and player, for a year, the current season or an entire career. The game modes include Exhibition, Season (play a full season along with management), Franchise (more than one season), some arcade street modes and the option to create custom tournaments.</desc>

    <name>NBA Hoopz</name>
    <desc>Rather than 5 on 5 action like professional play, this game features 3 on 3 play. Using players from the NBA, each player chooses a guard, forward, and center from the team's NBA roster for the first half and can make substitutions for the second half.    NBA Hoopz is an arcade-style game and not meant to be realistic: players can jump twenty or thirty feet in the air, dunk the ball from 20 feet (6.1 m) away, and do otherwise physically impossible things. Fouls are only called on flagrant pushes, foul shots are rare (and only after a number of fouls are accumulated), and there is no out of bounds. In addition, after a player makes three consecutive shots he becomes "on fire" which allows him to make almost any shot as well as goaltend without penalty.</desc>

    <name>Neo Golden Logres</name>
    <desc>Golden Logres is another pinball simulator by LittleWing. A sequel to both Tristan and Crystal Caliburn, the game features three tables based on the Arthurian legends: Camelot, Land's End and Fisher King. After completing all the missions on one table, the game moves to the next one. A practice mode is available to test the last two tables and prepare to the full game.    In Camelot, the first table, the objective is to complete all quests, each assigned to a different knight of the round table. The screen shows two medieval banners with the table sitting at the middle. The banners list the active quests, the score, the number of balls left and the status of the game. To start one of the adventures, the player must shoot ramps, sink the ball in holes or drop targets a number of times and then hit the Taliessin holder near the Merlin ramp. Taliessin was a court jester, musician and poet, and he assigns the quests to the knights. When an event occurs, like the end of a quest, a small window appears over the table with a picture and text explaining the situation. After all the quests are complete, the game moves to the next table after hitting the drop targets for the sloth, envy and lust sins, and sinking the ball in the quest hole.    In the second table called Land's End, Lancelot, Tristan and Gawain, the three knights considered the bravest of them all, must prove their courage by undertaking the most dangerous quests. A multiball starts after completing each adventure. Tristan has to kill the dragon, by shooting its ramp and turning on all the lights that spell its name, then sink the ball in the medicine and "myst" hole. Lancelot must lift the curse that fell upon Dolorous Gard, his castle, by shooting the castle ramp and turning on "CASTLE", and receive a gift from the Lady of the Lake after dropping the ball in the magic shield hole. Gawain has to defeat the Green Knight by hitting the "ERRANTRY" ramp to turn on the letter lights, and collect a proof of bravery from Lady Bercilak by getting the ball inside the sash hole. When all the quests are complete, the game switches back to Camelot automatically.    In the final Fisher King table, the ultimate goal is to collect the holy grail from the castle. The three guardians of the grail (Perceval, Bors, and Galahad) must acquire the holy relic and bring it back to Camelot. They receive the aid of other three fellow knights: Balin, Gareth and Palomides. Balin must get the Longinus spear that pierced Jesus on the cross, by turning on its name hitting the "LONGINUS" spot targets, and enter the castle at the top of the table. Gareth has to defeat the three evil knights, by sinking the ball in the challenge hole and dropping the red, blue and black targets, and finally send the ball to the castle to start a multiball. Palomides must kill Arthur's sin, that became a monster after his death, by shooting the beast lane turning on the "BEAST" lights, and sinking the ball in the castle. The grail knights retrieve the sacred cup by hitting the holy targets and the Perceval hole, both activated after colliding with bumpers named after each knight, turning on the "HOLY GRAIL" letters at the center. A multiball starts after entering the castle and receiving the grail. After all modes are finished, the game returns to Camelot.</desc>

    <desc>No refs... No rules... Just 'classic' gridiron. Late hits, pass interferences, and other penalties are encouraged (though you can't run offside). Cheerleaders in, well, cheerleading uniforms liven up the end of the first and third quarter and there's enough stats to make the mathematically inclined happy. However, the teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and it is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990's, but still a good game for someone who doesn't mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style football.</desc>

The game features 22 anime-like Characters in a 3-dimensional futuristic world - except for the backgrounds and the menus, which are plain 2D-bitmaps without a lot of movement. The stages are unlimited in all directions, so it's not possible to fall of the edge. The speciality of this game are the so called "plasma moves", visually very appealing special moves filling the complete screen which can be executed when you have collected enough "plasma power". Despite of the 22 characters there are only 11 different move layouts, as one layout is shared by two characters. </desc>

    <desc>The Sultan of Persia and his son-in-law are visiting the Sultan's brother, Assan. The friendly family meeting soon turns into a nightmare: Assan kills the young Prince's bodyguards, locks him up in a prison, and captures the Sultan. The reason is a little disagreement between the brothers regarding matrimonial arrangements: it appears that the Sultan had promised his daughter to Assan's son, Rugnor, and later broke his promise by letting her marry the Prince. In the resulting turmoil, the Sultan is killed, and the Princess is kidnapped by Rugnor, a ruthless half-tiger creature. The Prince must figure out a way to find Rugnor, defeat him, and rescue his wife.    Prince of Persia 3D is just what its title implies: an action platformer with puzzle-solving elements in the style of the previous Prince of Persia games, but set in a three-dimensional environment. The Prince still has to time his jumps, avoid deadly traps, interact with the environment, and fight Rugnor's minions who will try to stop him.</desc>

    <name>Psychic Force 2012</name>
    <desc>Psychic Force 2012,  the sequel to Psychic Force,  is a one-on-one fighting game with a twist. The matches take place inside a giant floating cube. You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty, Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons: guard, weak attack and strong attack. The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health.  Additionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either group.  The later PlayStation port, renamed to Psychic Force 2, adds the 3 missing characters from the first game (Genma, Brad and Sonia), the psy-expand mode where the player can play a series of special battles to learn other character attacks, and an anime intro video replacing the original in-game intro. It also lowers the overall difficulty of the CPU fighters and makes some control adjustments (for instance the shield can now optionally be enabled with a single button). Of course, the graphics were notably degraded.</desc>

    <name>Psyvariar 2 - The Will To Fabricate</name>
    <desc>Psyvariar 2 is another specimen of the recent breed of "newschool" arcade shoot'em'ups (other examples being Ikaruga and Border Down). As many other recently released shoot'em'ups, it combines basic arcade shooter gameplay with modern 3D graphics to liven up the genre. The level backgrounds as well as all enemies are modeled in full 3D, with the action taking place in a vertically scrolling two-dimensional plane which moves through the level.  As most of the other new-style SHMUPs, Psyvariar 2 has a gimmick: getting close to enemies or shots without actually being hit is called "buzzing" and yields massive extra score. In addition, the player ship's rate of fire is rather slow by default and can be raised by shaking the ship left and right a few times and then keeping moving horizontally - as soon as the horizontal movement stops, the fire rate drops down to normal again.   As in most other of the new Japanese style of shoot'em'ups, there are usually an  extremely high number of enemy shots on the screen. All these factors combine to make learning precise control a central part of the game.</desc>

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.  When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.  Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</desc>

    <name>Quake III Arena</name>
    <desc>The third game in the Quake series is a departure from the previous games, focusing exclusively on multiplayer arena fighting with no story-driven singleplayer part - directly competing with Epic Games that did the same with the contemporary Unreal Tournament.  The offline part takes the player through a number of one-on-one and team-based challenges against AI-controlled opponents, slowly ranking upwards in difficulty, as the character of the player's choosing. Compared to the previous titles, the colours and general design of the game are much brighter and it shakes off the dominant shades of brown and grey the previous titles in the series were known for. The player's arsenal consists of new and familiar, but redesigned weapons, including a gauntlet (melee attacks) and a machine gun as the spawn weapons, a shotgun, plasma gun, lightning gun, rocket launcher, railgun and BFG. Each weapon has specific advantages, ranging from the amount of damage to reloading times and the ability to hit-scan opponents.  The different arenas are also filled with health bubbles, complete sets of armour and armour shards, the well-known Quad Damage power-up, ammunition, and specials such as Mega Health, Haste, Invisibility, a powerful Battlesuit, and more. As with the other Quake games, it is known for its freedom in movement. Advanced players using techniques such as rocket jumping, strafing and circle jumping to quickly get around areas. The game offers more speed than Quake 2, but it is not as fast as the original Quake. Not everything was kept - the double jumping from the previous titles was removed for instance, but replaced with new tricks.  The singleplayer part only serves as a diversion for the online multiplayer options, with modes such as duel, team deathmatch (TDM), capture the flag (CTF) and more. As with Quake II, the vanilla version of the game was eventually heavily tweaked by the players' community with all-new tournament features (including voting, referees, banning, netcode updates), as it was used in professional Pro Gaming tournaments for almost ten years. </desc>

At the beginning, the player is given a choice of three different mecha-ships - one with a spread-gun, a weak homing laser, or a slow but powerful bubble gun. Additionally, each ship can use a sword for anything that gets too close, or specific enemies which can't be killed otherwise, a shield, which appears at the front of the ship once the player lets go of the fire button, and a smart-bomb-like field that can be extended around the player  in a small circle, damaging enemies, absorbing their shots and turning them into points.</desc>

Seeing as how no one can face Suede and his forces Silk drafts Cotton in order to restore peace to her land, but she may have forgotten that Cotton is a big fan of Willow candies herself...  Gameplay-wise Rainbow Cotton actually follows in the steps of Panorama Cotton as the gameplay switches from a 2D perspective to a 3rd person one. The gameplay itself however is reminiscent of games like Panzer Dragoon, in which you don't control Cotton as she flies, but instead where she aims with her magic spells. You can shoot down enemies as well as open chests, doors and other bonus locations for power-ups and spells, which advance Cotton's abilities in an rpg-lite fashion and increase your arsenal with different magical powers.  Taking advantage of the technological advances, the game uses for the first time polygonal graphics and to complement the action the game features 2D animated cutscenes between levels.</desc>

    <name>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing</name>
    <desc>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is a boxing video game developed by Midway and published in 1999 for the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Game Boy Color, and Nintendo 64. The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.    Like Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series, it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris "The Bear" Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over one's character in the ring. Also unlike Punch-Out!!, players can choose whichever boxer they want from a rather large selection of characters.    One unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game.</desc>

Three years after their mother-ship first orbited the earth the Haak were invited to the surface in peace and in the search for mutual rewards.  This agreement has been upheld for 7 years with only the occasional backlash causing small localised human/Haak conflict but the Haak have kept up their end of the bargain - until now.  We have started to lose contact with the human installations around the Haak settlements.  The first three recon forces sent to investigate the disturbances were shot out of the air.  The Red Dog Tactical Response Team is now preparing for war.

    <name>Reel Fishing | Wild</name>
    <desc>Reel Fishing: Wild is a Dreamcast-exclusive entry in the fishing simulation series. It allows players to catch two dozen species of fish in 14 different locations all over the world, from Japan to North and South America to Oceania. The Dreamcast fishing rod controller is supported for realistic castings and reel-ins.nnnnThe game starts in the fishing lodge, where players can check out a fish glossary, their catch list and their stock of lures, reels and lines and rods. Going for a round of fishing is done via the fishing notebook, which presents players with a series of challenges. At the start, only one location - a Japanese mountain stream - is unlocked. To unlock others, a certain number of a particular species must be caught. Catching fish not only opens up new locations, but also gives access to new types of lures, reels and lines, and rods, which in turn allow more successful fishing.nnnnA fishing session begins with a photo-realistic first-person view of the location created through combining digitized images with some animation, like for a waterfall or swaying trees, as well as disturbances of the water surface that hint at the best places for casting. Once the line is cast and a fish moves near the lure, the view switches to a 3D underwater view, showing fish, line, and hook in close-up. Baiting, setting the hook, and reeling in the catch are then done in this view.</desc>

    <name>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</name>
    <desc>So Evil they even gave it a subtitle!  The final installment of the Resident Evil series for the Playstation, Resident Evil 3 takes place during the events of Resident Evil 2. The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. As Jill "master of unlocking" Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original Resident Evil), you must find a way out of the zombie-infested remains of the city alive. Along the way, you'll interact with and receive help from three heavily armed Umbrella mercenaries who have also become stranded in Raccoon City thanks to the incompetence of their employer. Standing in the way of your group's last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill.  A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis possesses the same maneuverability as Jill allowing him to run (faster than you, in fact), use firearms (such as a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we've come to know and... well, know from Umbrella's ultimate bio-weapons.   Like its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, improvements include auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows you to avoid enemy attacks by pressing a button a second before they strike. Another addition is Jill's ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. Compared to Resident Evil 2, the amount of available ammunition and healing items has been significantly decreased, making the game more difficult. The variety of zombie citizens has also been made more diverse.  The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another welcome addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation.  The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill's possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score. </desc>

    <name>Resident Evil Code: Veronica</name>
    <desc>Three months after the events of Resident Evil 2, Claire Redfield is still looking for her brother Chris. She infiltrates Umbrella Corporation's headquarters in Paris, where she is captured and knocked out. When she comes to, she finds herself in a prison on a remote island. Freed by a friendly guard, Claire faces several problems. Not only is the island under attack by an unknown assailant, but there has been another outbreak of the T-Virus and the island is crawling with zombies and other mutated creatures. Claire not only has to face the undead, but also the commander of the base, a mad aristocrat with family ties to the origins of Umbrella Corporation and the T-Virus. And escaping from the island is only the beginning of Claire's ordeals.  Code: Veronica continues the survival horror gameplay of its predecessors: the protagonist explores the surroundings, fighting monsters and solving puzzles. However, Code: Veronica is the first game in the series to do away with pre-rendered backgrounds, using a fully polygonal 3D engine instead, which allows for features such as real-time lighting and camera movement. Still, such movements are only used sparingly, and the use of perspective is mostly unchanged from earlier installments: the camera automatically switches to different static angles, showing protagonist, monsters and rooms from different spooky viewpoints.  Most of the weapons from the earlier games make return appearances: knife, handguns, shotgun, grenade launcher and crossbow are all featured. There are also new weapons including a sniper rifle, an AK-47 and several guns only found in pairs, which can be used to target two enemies at the same time. Several weapons upgrades can also be found.  Similar to the earlier games, the player will not only control Claire, but also two other characters: Claire's fellow prisoner Steve, and her brother Chris. </desc>

    <name>Re-Volt</name>
    <desc>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live!   Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from.   There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places.   In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.</desc>

The game has 8 racers and 34 cars from which you can choose from and 4 modes in total:  1. Roadster Trophy – The player starts by selecting one of the available racers and is given a sum of money that must be used to acquire a car. There are 3 divisions in which the player can compete on with the 3rd being of the easiest difficulty and requiring less money to participate;  the 1st being the most difficult one and needing a higher amount of money in order to participate. More money can be earned by winning the races and that in turn allows to buy new cars or upgrade the ones that are already in  possession.  Multi-Player – Multi-player mode supports up to 2 human players that can compete in any of the available circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen.   Quick Race – In Quick Race the player can select the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions, and race against 7 more CPU controlled players.  Time Trial – Like Quick Race mode, the player can also select here the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions but without the competition of the other modes, the player races against time for as many laps as the player wants.</desc>

The controller senses which region in space out of a possible 6 that the maracas are in.  It also senses when the player shakes the maracas.  As the music plays, the player must shake the maracas in the appropriate region with proper timing to progress.  A standard controller can also be used if you do not have the maracas controller, which is sold separately.  The music in the game comes from a wide variety of sources.  Some of the songs are traditional samba music, while others are recognizable pop tunes, like "Macarena" and "Tequila."</desc>

Each character's appearance can be altered by the player as well.  Using sonar the player can cruise around the lake until he find a good fishing spot. Besides the location the player can also pick the month, time of day and weather in which he wants to fish. All these factors are calculated when it comes to determining what kind of fish he or she is likely to catch. To aid the player there's 100 different kinds of lures to fish with.  The game is meant to be played with the special fishing rod controller.  There are two game modes: free fishing and tournament mode. In the first you can do what you wish and try to improve on your own records. In the latter mode you have to compete against NPCs or another player. There are various tiers of difficulty.</desc>

    <desc>You're the Shadow Man, a person who can switch between the world of the dead and of the living. In Shadow Man your mission is to prevent 5 serial killers from bringing the total armageddon. In the world of the living, you're mortal and have conventional weapons. When you die, you are transported to the world of the dead and you become Shadow Man once again. Which means you're not really mortal. In the world of the dead you can't use normal weapons, your gun shoots ghosts which kill the zombies and the other ugly creatures which live there. You also have different voodoo powers and weapons. And you're carrying a large inventory around.</desc>

    <name>Shenmue II</name>
    <desc>Shenmue 2 is the sequel to the innovative free-roaming RPG Shenmue. Continuing on exactly from where the original left off, Shenmue 2 furthers the story of Ryo Hazuki and his search for his fathers murderer, Lan-Di, as well as the events surrounding the murder.  Taking place in China, Shenmue 2 contains a real world gameplay system first seen in the original Shenmue. This puts you in a world where hundreds of people live out their daily lives around you, day turns to evening and on into night. It rains and snows, you can get part time jobs to earn extra money for rent or even gamble or play real classic arcade games like Outrun at the local video arcade all within a living breathing city. There is also a battle mode for those occasions when Ryo gets himself into fights as well as quick time events that require you to act quickly in the heat of some tense situations.  The Xbox version of the game came with an additional DVD called Shenmue: The Movie, which contained a summation of the first Shenmue game made into a feature length movie. This was to help people who didn't own a Dreamcast understand the plot from the previous game, since it was never released for the Xbox.</desc>

    <desc>That day in November when the snow turned to rain. Ryu Hazuki arrives home just in time to see his father killed by Lan Di, a man Ryu's father obviously knew very well. Ryu attempts to stop Lan Di, but is effortlessly beaten to within an inch of his life. After recovering from his injuries Ryu sets out to track down his father's murder as well as uncover his family's secrets and the mystery of the Phoenix and Dragon mirrors that Lan Di seeks.  Much of Shenmue's gameplay involves talking to Ryu's friends and the various people around town, hoping to find hints or clues that lead to the next step in the story. Any details Ryu learns are written down in his notebook for future review. Ryu can buy items from stores or try his luck with capsule toy machines, but the vast majority of items you can buy have no purpose outside of filling out your inventory screen. Ryu can also visit an arcade and play arcade accurate versions of  Hang-On and Space Harrier as well as games like darts and pool.  Ryu is a trained martial artist, and while a true martial artist knows it is better to avoid a fight, sometimes it is still necessary. Ryu can train his moves, either by repeatedly doing them while training, or by sparing with his friend Fuku-san. Fighting plays like a simplified Virtua Fighter game, although with toned down air juggling. Ryu's training also gives him heightened reflexes, and sometimes during a cutscene the player will have only a moment to press a button (displayed onscreen) to get Ryu out of danger. Failing an input prompt is not always fatal, but whether Ryu survives or not depends on the danger he was in.  Included with the game is the Shenmue Passport disc. On this disc players can receive tutorials about various aspects of the game like minigames or the battle system, watch cutscenes they've already seen in the game, and listen to music from the game. This disc also includes the option to go online to a special site where players can review world-wide minigame rankings, get hints for the game from Nozomi, review game maps of Yokosuka, trade uncommon items found in the game for even rarer items only available on the passport, and visit the official homepage. This service went offline along with the rest of SegaNet, and all online features are currently impossible to access.</desc>

    <desc>Arcadia is a world where continents float high above, and people travel by airships. Among the countries of this world, the most powerful one is the Empire of Valua. Guided by its greedy admirals, Valua strives to possess all the power in Arcadia. The boy Vyse and the girl Aika are members of the Blue Rogues - noble pirates who attack only Valuan war ships. During one of their confrontations with a battle ship, they encounter a girl named Fina, who is on an important mission whose secret she cannot tell yet. Involved in the conflict with the Empire of Valua, the trio of the heroes must explore the whole world of Arcadia in order to defeat the admirals.  "Skis of Arcadia" is a traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based combat and randomly appearing enemies. During battles, you can accumulate spirit points and then unleash powerful special attacks. Beside the usual party-based combat, there are also ship battles in the game, where you plan several turns ahead, using various kinds of ship weapons.</desc>

    <desc>A terrorist organization has stolen nuclear weapons from a facility in Russia, intending to sell them to various third-world nations, initiating a global conflict. The player takes the role of John Mullins, a US mercenary working for an organization known as "The Shop". The goal is simple: hunt the villains across the globe, thwart their evil plans, and save the world!  Like most 3D shooters, Soldier of Fortune consists mainly of exploring the environments and killing the enemies that try to impede the player's progress. It is one of the first shooters to isolate over 20 different body regions and show/inflict damage to those regions. For example, if the player character shoots an enemy in the foot, the enemy will limp. The game was also notable for including realistic gore animations resulting from the injuries sustained by the enemies.</desc>

    <desc>Yet again Sonic and friends find themselves wrapped up in the schemes of Dr. Robotnik. This time he plans to exploit the power of Chaos, a malevolent being that feeds upon the power of the Chaos Emeralds. In their own ways five heroes will do what they can to save Station Square and, perhaps, the entire world.  The player can select from which character to play after meeting them with Sonic, and each has their own unique version of each level. Sonic's levels involve racing through a level as quickly as possible, destroying any robots along the way. Tails can hover over distances, and his levels are similar to Sonic's except that he must beat an opponent to the finish line. Amy can't charge up ramps or run as quickly as Sonic and Tails, but she does have a giant hammer she can break obstacles with. The goal of her levels is to avoid being captured by a robot sent after her by Dr. Robotnik. E102 Gamma is a slow, difficult to maneuver robot, but it has guns and missiles that can lock on to several targets at once, chaining together attacks and earning a higher score and more time on the clock. The goal of its levels is to reach a boss enemy and destroy it before time runs out. The final character is Big the Cat, a fisherman searching for his lost frog. Big's levels are almost entirely devoid of action or fighting; he just fishes. Each character can find items that increase their abilities as the story progresses, such as a ring for Sonic that lets him home along lines of rings, or improved lures for Big. A final chapter wrapping up the story is unlocked after all other characters have been completed.  Additionally each of the characters can visit the Chao garden where they can raise baby Chaos. By petting, feeding, and showing animals found in levels to the Chaos they can grow stronger, and optionally be put into races against other Chaos. As well each level in the game has additional objectives that can be completed to acquire extra emblems, although the emblems don't do anything in this version of the game. Finally at one time it was possible to go online and download additional levels and bonuses in the game, such a Christmas theme for Station Square and a level sponsored by AT&amp;T, but since SegaNet shut down this is no longer possible.</desc>

Each character has a group of cards with a number on each. On every turn the player chooses a card to determine how many steps to take. When all of the cards have been used the deck is reshuffled, and each player gets a new hand. While a player can see only the numbers on their own cards, and not the numbers on other players' cards, they can still choose the cards of another player.  Each board has certain tiles: blue adds 3 rings to your total; red removes 3 rings from your total and special tiles which places all of the players into a min-game or event.  The aim of the game, at the end of it all, is to get the Precioustone (1 per board).</desc>

All characters have weapons and distinct fighting styles with over 100 individual moves per character.  In addition to high, mid, and low attacks, characters can hold/throw, block, and perform special attacks -- one or more of which is deemed "un-blockable" and must be avoided by ducking, jumping, or rotating around your attacker.   In addition to several locales in which to fight and alternate models/costumes per character, the Dreamcast conversion of Soul Calibur contains many additional features over the arcade coin-op, including hidden characters and locales, a campaign mode, and tournament mode.  There is also a "museum" where you can view character profiles and view motion-captured martial arts demonstrations.</desc>

You only get so many shots with your weapon before it breaks, though.  Gameplay is basic 3D brawling. You will be attacked by one or more enemies, and will need to defend yourself, and attack back. The game features arcade and adventure modes. In the arcade mode, the levels are timed, and you only get 5 lives but you are revived where you died. In adventure mode, you get unlimited retries of each level, but must complete each level on a single life.  Note that your objective in each level is to kill every enemy; since the levels have multiple paths, you will need to backtrack often.</desc>

    <name>Spider-man</name>
    <desc>Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger.  It is loosely based on Spider-Man: The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs.  Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius's new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device.  Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device's theft.  This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.  Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized.  He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.  Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.  Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.  There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.</desc>

    <name>Striker Pro 2000</name>
    <desc>European soccer game based around the UEFA license.  Effectively a merger between Rage software's Striker franchise and playstation/dreamcast evolution with Infogrames' UEFA license.   UEFA Striker offered a mix of arcade and simulation style gameplay and a certification mode, where the player was tested for skills in order to unlock game modes.  The game featured many clubs from around the world in some form or another, but in it's primary game tournament mode was focused around European clubs.  In addition to simple and quick selection of a 'friendly match' the game supported the following tournaments:  Super Trophy - Featuring up to 32 teams drawn from a pool of over 40 of the most popular European teams.  In round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice.  The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four teams.  The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties.  National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests.  Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way.  This was likely because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they automatically qualified as a result).  The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals.  Group ties resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded.  The best of out of all those teams which placed second in the groups also goes forward.  The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four going through to the finals.  National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers.  The remaining 16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once.  The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals.  Penalty shootouts settle ties.  Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of each cup unlocks the next territory.  8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition.  The game also supported generic league and knockout tournament play, as well a classic matches - four preconfigured scenarios replaying historical matches.  Live commentary was from Ron Atkinson and Jonathan Pearce.</desc>

The cars can be tuned up with many different tuning parts, like better batteries, tires, suspension etc. - a total of 1000 different combinations.  You race on 24 original, colorful tracks with tons of bridges, ramps and loopings. You can perform absolutely breathtaking stunts on these tracks, but you need to be careful about the battery - if the car runs out of power, the race is probably over very soon.  Of course, it's possible to play multiplayer. No network support is included, so multiplayer gaming stages on one PC in split screen mode.</desc>

The professor must stop her, so her sends Super Magnetic Neo, a little boy robot with a powerful electromagnet on his head.  The game has some resemblance to the Crash Bandicoot series in that some levels have you running toward the camera, have a side-view, or have you riding an animal.  It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer.  However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect.  Positive and Negative charges are represented by red and blue.  Neo's head can act as a positive or negative pole.  This is called his magnogimmick.  Using the principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on magnetic pendulums.  Enemies also come in red and blue and can pulled pulled in to be captured or pushed away to be avoided accordingly.  You must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao Park and defeat Pinki.  There is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based around proper use of the magnogimmick.  It's something like the VR missions in the Metal Gear series.</desc>

Upon arriving, they learn of a disease that transforms its victims into "Mandragorans", making them go berserk and kill people, even their loved ones, without thinking. The ruler of the castle, Baron Balzac, learns of Guts killing a Mandragoran and brings him to the dungeon where people infected with the disease are kept. Balzac brings Guts to his laboratory while explaining that he is searching for a supposed cure. Guts learns from Balzac that the disease comes from an unusual plant, the Mandragora that grew into a tree located in a nearby village on the borders of his domain. After meeting a group of rebels that abducted Casca and learning the baron is a tyrant to their people, Guts decides to carry out Balzac's request for the Great Tree's heart since the baron's findings might provide a cure for Casca's madness. But while Guts is joined by Rita and a group of rebels, Balzac's men raid the rebels' hideout and capture Casca.</desc>

    <name>Sydney 2000</name>
    <desc>The official video game of the Games of the XXVII Olympiad held in 2000 in Sydney. It includes 32 nations, going for gold in 12 events divided by 6 sports: Athletics (100m dash, 110m hurdles, hammer and javelin throw, triple jump and high jump), Aquatics (200m freestyle and 10m platform diving), Kayak K1 Slalom, Super Heavyweight Weight Lifting, Skeet Shooting and Three-man track cycling pursuit. All events feature 3D graphics with cameras that mimic the ones used in TV broadcasts.  Gameplay is the usual found in games of the genre - button mashing the two power buttons is required in most events to build up strength/speed, with an additional third button setting the actions, such as jumping or throwing angle. Other events feature alternate control methods, such as Slalom (where it's possible to press certain buttons to dodge the rower between the gates if the Kayak is going to hit one or place the paddle to force into a certain direction),  Diving (following a "click-along" sequence of keys) and Skeet (the direction keys controlling the aim, one button to start and other to shoot).  Along an arcade and 8-player action, the Olympic mode gives the player the option to build their athlete from the national open trials to the Olympics. By completing training drills in the Cyber Gym, the athlete increases his athletic abilities: Citius, Altius, Fortius, as told by the Olympic Motto. Before joining the competition, the player must beat national, continental and international opponents.</desc>

    <name>Tech Romancer</name>
    <desc>Tech Romancer is a 3D beat-em-up with a difference; the difference being that, rather than controlling one of a set of martial artists, you control one of a set of huge robots (or mecha). Ranging from the absurd (A huge, spherical mech with a boat and bus for feet, a house for a head, train for one arm and office building with wrecking ball for another) to the "typical" anime styled mecha (Beam-firing chest gem, detatchable rocket-powered fists) to a more westernised idea of a mech (Huge, sluggish, equipped with heavy cannon, rockets, missiles and land-mines), you're bound to find at least one which suits you. The gameplay takes part in large, 3D arenas, usually dotted with buildings and such, which you'll no doubt be happy to learn are destructable (and often contain powerups). The game controls consist of two attack buttons, one block and one jump. You have a special bar, which works pretty much the same as any other special bar - once it's full (up to a maximum of 3 times) you can pull off a special move. There's an armour bar, which depletes as you take or block certain hits - if it runs out then you'll start taking hefty damage even when blocking. The life and time-bars are self-explanatory, and there's also the special-weapon inventory, which can hold up to five special weapons at a time (these are picked up from the battlefield or stolen off the enemy). The main single-player mode is a story mode, which is completely different for each character and, for most characters at least, branches many ways, often with multiple endings depending on choices made and targets met.  To put it simply, this is a quirky pick-up-and-play fighting game with an extensive single-player mode.</desc>

    <desc>Sequel to the original game which was released two years prior.    The games graphics have been improved, and there is a greater roster of players to choose from. The most noteworthy addition is that of female players, such as Monica Seles and Venus and Serena Williams. You cannot however play as a male against a female.    The gameplay is a lot faster than the original. The players you control move a lot faster, as do the AI computer players. Less diving, but more getting at shots that go behind you and over the shoulder shots.    The game modes from the original are the same, featuring tournament mode, where you play against the pros; exhibition mode for a one-on-one, best-out-of-three game; and world tour mode which now features the option of creating and customizing your own player. Build you player up, buy equipment and hire pros to play in doubles matches with you.</desc>

    <name>Test Drive V-Rally</name>
    <desc>Need for Speed returns to dirt racing again in this sequel to Need for Speed: V-Rally. The most significant differences are the track editor, improved graphics, and new game modes. There are 84 tracks and the game supports multiplayer with up to four players. This second installment comes with four game modes: an arcade mode for casual rally fans, a championship mode for people who want to compete against other rally cars for a title, a trophy mode, and a time trial mode.    It features 16 different cars in three categories: World Rally Cars (Peugeot 206, Hyundai Coupe, Mitsubishi Lancer, Toyota Corolla, Subaru Impreza, Ford Focus, SEAT CÃ³rdoba, Å koda Octavia), 2L kit-cars (Peugeot 306, CitroÃ«n Xsara, SEAT Ibiza, Renault Megane, Vauxhall Astra) and 1.6L kit-cars (CitroÃ«n Saxo, Peugeot 106, Nissan Micra). A number of bonus cars can be unlocked as well by completing certain modes, such as winning the European or the World Championship.    In the arcade mode you race against three opponents on the race track; whoever reaches the finish line first after a series of laps wins the stage. However, the main goal in a stage is to reach the next checkpoint before the countdown timer stops. Several stages form a level, for which you receive a total of three credits. Every time you fail to reach a checkpoint before the time runs out the race stops and you can use a credit to restart that particular stage. If there are no credits left, the entire level must be restarted. The trophy mode is a bit different. While winning a stage is still done by beating three opponents directly on the race track, to claim the trophy you have to register the best overall result, calculated by summing up all the stages' times.    The championship mode is designed after the FIA World Rally Championship, where drivers compete for points. The European championship is divided into eight rounds, while the World and the Expert championships each have twelve. Every round has two (European, World) or three stages (Expert). This is the only mode where the car gets damaged if handled badly, but it can be repaired at the service park between stages in the following areas: engine, gear box, brakes, steering and suspensions. You only have 30 minutes, so if your car is seriously messed up you will not be able to restore it to a 100% condition for the next stage. At the end of the round the total time for all stages is compared between racers and the first six positions in the standings get a number of points based on their performance (for example the fastest gets 10 points, 2nd place gets 6 points, and so on). Whoever has the most points after all the rounds becomes the new champion.    In the track editor the track is represented by a single line or ribbon. You can edit the curves and change the inclines or declines of each track piece. The only restriction is that trackpieces cannot overlap, so for example you cannot make an 8-shaped track. When playing the track, scenery is added procedurally depending on the curves and inclines and which country is selected. The 84 default tracks make use of the same engine.</desc>

    <name>Tetris 4D</name>
    <desc>Tetris 4D is a fairly standard Tetris game that was released in Japan shortly after the Dreamcast launched.  The game features two modes, Classic and Battle. Classic mode offers a normal solitaire Tetris game: rotate and fit falling blocks to complete lines. Five difficulty settings are available, which change the speed and piece preview settings.  The sound and graphics generally follow a modern urban/industrial theme, with five techno music choices, including a variation of the classic Tetris "Karinka". The 3D backgrounds are basic but shift viewpoint as you advance in levels.  The Battle mode offers two to four player multiplayer. One player starts off flagged, and blocks push up from the bottom as other players make lines. Once he makes enough lines himself the flag moves to another player. Difficulty is set independently allowing for handicaps.  Unfortunately, you can't play the battle mode against the computer. There's also no VMU support for saving high scores, a rather critical omission for this type of game.</desc>

Released in 1999 as one of the console's launch titles, the game was one of the first mission-based racing games. The gameplay involves the player challenging other drivers on the Shuto Expressway in order to gain money to modify and enhance his or her car. The game features a wide variety of Japanese cars and tuning parts to purchase as the player progresses through rivals.    When released in Japan, ShutokÅ  Battle was one of the best selling Dreamcast titles at this time. The game is based on illegal highway racing in Tokyo's Wangan highway with custom tuned cars. A such phenomenon is growing popular in Japan since the 90's with its dedicated manga (ShutokÅ  Battle's biggest inspiration being Wangan Midnight), anime series and video games (C1 Circuit, Wangan Trial, Naniwa Wangan Battle).</desc>

    <name>Toy Commander</name>
    <desc>Some of the greatest adventures that kids have growing up occur in their imaginations as they play with their toys.  Toy Commander is a game that attempts to capture these adventures in an interactive, three dimensional world. The player's perspective is that of the toy vehicles that inhabit a house. The various gameplay areas are all based on rooms in this giant house.   Gameplay in Toy Commander is mission based.  In each mission, you control one or more toy vehicles to accomplish certain objectives. The objectives in each mission vary widely.  In some missions, you must drive an army truck and shoot things, in some you fly helicopters to pick up and drop off objects, and in some you must race against computer controlled vehicles.   There is a story line that ties together the missions in single player mode. A coalition of old toys has started a rebellion against the new toys in the house. An evil Teddy Bear, the Toy Commander, is leading this rebellion.  It's your job to stop him. In each mission, your basic goal is to complete the task in as short a time as possible.  If you meet a certain time goal, the mission is completed.  By completing 4 missions, you get to challenge the Boss character in the room.  If you successfully destroy the boss, he will assist you in the final fight against the Toy Commander.  In addition to the single player mode, there is a 4-player simultaneous deathmatch mode.</desc>

    <desc>A unique combination of vertically-scrolling shooters and competitive puzzle games, Twinkle Star Sprites tells the story of the apprentice witch Ran, who searches for the fabled Twinkle Star that is said to grant any wish to the one that finds it. Unfortunately she is not the only one seeking the star, and thus must fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in shooter duels.  The game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area,  a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special "boss" characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.  Each player has a lifebar, and as with most shooters there are bombs, and collectible power-ups to be found. The game features an arcade mode in which you can freely select what character you want to control, as well as a 2-player Vs mode and a story mode chronicling Ran's journey. </desc>

What makes the game (and the real-life counterpart) distinct from wrestling, boxing, and other fights is the variety of fighting styles in use; it is perfectly possible to end up with a judo master facing a kickboxer.  The actual gameplay is simple enough. You have various basic moves, combos, holds, and so on. The complications come in the form of the huge list of moves, featuring many different styles. Hit your opponent until he gets knocked out, or force him to tap out early.  There are multiple game modes included. Among them are a survival mode, that has you face a string of enemies with minimal recovery, and career mode, which allows you to customize and improve your fighting style as you win fights.</desc>

While the gameplay is fairly typical for a vertical shooters, Under Defeat innovates by allowing players to tilt their vehicles slightly left and right, changing the angle of their fire. The game was available in two different editions - a regular version, and a collector's edition pack that included a soundtrack CD. Unlike most Dreamcast games which traditionally shipped in a jewel case, both versions of Under Defeat came in a DVD-sized keep case.</desc>

    <desc>Unreal Tournament is completely different to Unreal - it's now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3.   At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about 3 or 4 different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The 3rd mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point.   The 4th game mode is probably the most innovative one, it's called assault. These are real missions, like you have to attack an enemy base and destroy something in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, like 5 or 10 minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.  All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots.  Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.</desc>

Your position at the end of the race depends solely on your time, not on your finishing position relative to other cars. What's more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down.  The standard racing game modes are here:  Tournament, Time Trial, and Single Race.  One unique feature, however, is the stunt competition.  You can compete in a series of events that test various driving skills in timed events.  Some example events are the long jump and the slalom.  The selection of cars is quite diverse.  You can race vehicles that range from low performance, like a VW Microbus, to high performance, like a Dodge Viper.</desc>

    <desc>World Series Baseball 2K1 features the actual players, teams, and stadiums of the 2000 baseball season.  You can play an exhibition game or a season of 13-162 games, including an All-Star game and play-offs.  Gameplay is the standard behind-the-catcher viewpoint for batting and pitching, switching to different views after the ball is hit.  The famous limitation of World Series Baseball 2K1 is that you cannot control the fielders until after the ball is fielded!  For this reason the game was almost universally panned by reviewers upon its release.  This flaw was fixed in subsequent releases of the World Series Baseball franchise.</desc>

    <desc>Zero Gunner 2 would on first inspection appear to be a bog-standard 2D shooter. However this import game actually has a bit of a unique "spin" on the shooter genre.  Most noticable, all backdrops and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D. The textures are quite highly detailed and this adds more depth than standard 2D shooters. Secondly, since your craft is a helicopter, a unique "target and spin" feature has been added whereby you can both rotate your craft to better attack an enemy or alternatively to lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. This is all controlled by the player however and is not automatic; to succeed mastering this feature is imperative.  The usual power-ups and bosses are included, along with a selection of helicopters to select from.</desc>

		<name>'H'Fast Striker</name>
		<desc>Fast Striker is an arcade-style vertical shooter with a science fiction setting. While the game is essentially 2D, the backgrounds consists of pre-rendered 3D graphics. This game features six stages with over 40 enemy types.    You can choose between 3 game modes (Novice, Original and Maniac) with different scoring systems. The modes differ, for example, in the set of available techniques. In comparison to the Novice mode, the Original mode features a shield to protect the ship, which can be activated for a short time, and holding the down the spread fire button will also shoot rockets after a few moments. Furthermore, the enemies are colored differently in Novice mode to make them more visible, and you collect golden stars as part of the scoring system. The Maniac mode adds some new ways to get higher scores. For example, the distance between your ship and an enemy influences the score: you get a larger bonus the nearer you are to the enemy ship when you destroy it. Destroying many enemies in short time will also increase the number of awarded points. Last, you can activate a "Grind Mode" by focusing your ship's laser beam on a huge enemy. The beam will turn green after a while and then all destroyed enemies will give a higher score.</desc>

		<path>./Triggerheart Exelica (Japan).chd</path>
		<name>Trigger Heart Exelica</name>
		<desc>In the distant future humanity will develop intelligent weapons called Trigger Hearts. Despite their awesome offensive strengths, Trigger Hearts aesthetically closely resemble humans, and overtime even develop unique personalities. Of three existing Trigger Hearts one, named Faintear, has mysteriously vanished two years ago. The story begins as the two remaining Trigger Hearts - Exelica and Crueltear (who took on the personality of Exelica's big sister) are summoned to quell a mysterious rebellion of military machines against their human creators.  Trigger Heart Exelica is an arcade-style top-down shooter and is composed of 5 stages of shooting mayhem. Most levels take place in futuristic environments such as sky cities and space stations. The player is given a choice of one of the two Trigger Hearts at the beginning of the game - Exelica, who emits a wide fan of weak shots, and Crueltear, who fires a narrowly concentrated barrage of projectiles. However, the firing pattern of guns matters little during the game, as Trigger Heart's most awesome weapon is common to both models, and is called the Anchor Shot. By using the Anchor Shot Trigger Hearts are able to grab, swing, use as a shield, and hurl back any flying enemy vehicle in the game, including even the most giant of enemy battle cruisers. When thrown, the enemy cuts a path of destruction across the entire screen, causing explosive chain reactions between adjacent ships and occasionally even obliterating bosses in one hit. The Anchor Shot is a tricky weapon to use, as it requires the player to circle the joystick in order to give enemy ships more inertia while continuing to dodge enemy fire. The trajectory of the released enemy is also somewhat difficult to predict. Another innovative feature of Trigger Heart Exelica is AI-adjusted boss difficulty level, which will cut more slack to the inexperienced player, while attempting to punish the pros.  In addition to the original Arcade mode the home version of the game includes a Story mode, which adds fully voiced cutscenes, additional endings and bosses throughout the game, and Arranged Mode, which is just like the arcade mode, but is limited to Normal difficulty, no continues, and only two lives, and serves as a challenge to the most experienced players.  The PS2 port includes a new opening movie, story mode and CG sequences. TH44 Faintear is now a player selectable fighter and The Triggerheart Backupper C'r_na, originally only a story concept, now appears in the game.</desc>

The gameplay is a lot faster than the original. The players you control move a lot faster, as do the AI computer players. Less diving, but more getting at shots that go behind you and over the shoulder shots.    The game modes from the original are the same, featuring tournament mode, where you play against the pros; exhibition mode for a one-on-one, best-out-of-three game; and world tour mode which now features the option of creating and customizing your own player. Build you player up, buy equipment and hire pros to play in doubles matches with you.</desc>

The game moves you automatically, although you can find hiding places to shoot from a safe angle. Your main task is to aim and fire your weapon so as to take out the bad guys for points. Avoid the innocents, as shooting them costs you points. The enemies have tougher firepower than in the original.</desc>

    <name>Wild Metal</name>
    <desc>Wild Metal Country is an action game in which one of five little tanks can be selected to control. Tank-like machines have gone wild on the three different planets of the Tehric system and the player's job is to defeat them.  The battles take place in desolate mountain environments. The big differences in altitude play an important role in the game. In the single player mode, complete levels by collecting 8 colored power cores, which are defended by the machines, and returning them to one of several hovering stores. The player has an infinite amount of lives. The weaponry consists of 8 types of missiles and 4 types of mines. Help is received from a pair of helicopters that drop ammo and provide healing.  The two tracks of the tank are operated independently. For example, make a quick spin by going forward with one track and backwards with the other. Moreover the turret can be turned in any direction. The camera always moves with the turret sometimes diverting the view towards the camera. The angle of the turret and the distance the rockets travel can be changed. The tank can only be controlled using the keyboard.  Noteworthy aspects of the game are: the physics modelling, the 3D engine and the amount of freedom the player has (no time constraints etc.). </desc>

    <name>Worms Armageddon</name>
    <desc>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17's WORMNET.   For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep.   Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.  Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it's not a huge change.</desc>

    <desc>The Worms are back, deadlier than ever. You're going to learn that there's nothing more dangerous than a Worm with a bazooka or a shotgun...  At first sight, Worms World Party may seem very similar to Worms Armageddon. However, this time the game has been specially designed with multiplayer in mind. Up to 6 players can battle out at the same time on local networks or on the internet, using Team17 own matchmaking service, called Wormnet.  Other welcomed additions are the Wormpot, which can provide 400 gameplay variations from "Goliath Mode" to "Bleeding Worms", hundreds of new landscapes, flags and fanfares, and a load of single player missions.</desc>

		<name>Dux</name>
		<desc>DUX is a scrolling shooter in the vein of R-Type. When scientists searched for new materials to enhance their space ships, they discovered a new and powerful material they dubbed DUX. Since this type of material proved unstable, nobody except the player seemed brave enough to fly the space ship constructed from it. The player's job is to lead the ship through a series of horizontal levels against the Spiritual Spacers "to reach the obvious."

The player's ship has a standard laser shot that can be upgraded or changed for x-ray and bounce shots, which are very similar to the weapons in R-Type. The player also has a pod that protects them from enemy bullets and that can be launched as an offensive weapon in a move called "dash." Keeping the fire button pressed will launch a more powerful hyper shot.

To score points, the player can destroy chains of enemies in quick succession or soak up chains of bullets. Hyper Soaking makes the player invulnerable to bullets, but drains the Obvious Energy gauge if not enough bullets are soaked in or new energy orbs are picked up. The player wins the game if they manage to beat all the bosses at the end of each level. If they are hit by a bullet or collide with their surroundings, a life is lost. After all lives and continues are depleted, the game is over.</desc>
